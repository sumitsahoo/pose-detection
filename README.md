# üèÉüèª YOLO Pose Detection Project

This project uses the YOLO (You Only Look Once) real-time object detection system, specifically the Ultralytics implementation, to perform pose detection.

## üì¶ Dependencies

This project requires the Ultralytics YOLO library. You can install it with poetry:

```bash
poetry add ultralytics
```

Run the app with poetry:

```bash
poetry run python main.py
```


## üë®üèª‚Äçüíª Usage
The main script for this project is main.py. It loads a YOLO model trained for pose detection and uses it to perform pose detection on webcam input.

```python
from ultralytics import YOLO

model = YOLO("yolov8m-pose.pt")  # Load model

results = model(source=0, show=True, conf=0.3, save=True)  # Webcam
```
In this script, source=0 tells the model to use the webcam as the input source. show=True will display the webcam feed with the pose detection overlay. conf=0.3 sets the confidence threshold for detections, and save=True will save the output frames.
